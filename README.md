# Free-Food-For-All
Group Project processing, analyzing, and interpreting real data from a local non-profit organization.

Free Food For All is a nonprofit in the Greater Seattle Area that aims to increase awareness on individual and societal waste. 
A large part of their efforts go to redistributing and recovering surplus food from vendors and grocery stores to those in need. 

Through the use of data visualization, our project means to showcase the quantifiable work that Free Food For All has accomplished. 
It's in our hope that the public and all people/organizations involved with Free Food For All see the impact made by the organization.
